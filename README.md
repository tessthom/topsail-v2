# Topsail Beach Visitor Site

## Bootstrap version

This project is a 90's beach ad aesthetic inspired overhaul of the [Topsail Beach Visitor's page(s)](https://topsailbeachnc.gov/Visitors/Things-To-Do). I wanted to see if I could make a slimmed down riff on Vacation Inc's site aesthetic with just a sprinkling of JS.

Bootstrap was a requirement for this project. I am admittedly not a fan of a lot of the restrictions/built-in properties that come with this requirement and found myself wishing I could just write CSS from scratch throughout. I'd love to work with Open Props or something else more incrementally adoptable and easier to fold into a vanilla CSS workflow next time.

### Notes

- All media is from the assigned Topsail Beach inspo site, CC0 from Pexels, or of my own ownership or making in Figma.
- JavaScript is modular not out of necessity, rather to get in the habit of it.
- Reworking with a lighter FE framework or pure CSS TBD.
